# ellipsoid
Simple code to make ellipsoid in Python.

The code can be used in two ways:
- If only the matrix of points is known, the center, radii and rotation can be computed using the Ellipsoid class and the corresponding ellipsoid plotted using ellipsoid function. 

- If the matrix of point and the center is known, the plot_ellpisoid function can be used directly to make ellipsoid.
